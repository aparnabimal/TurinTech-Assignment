Description of the project:
This project includes the attached file 'TurinTech Assignment.ipynb', which is the main executable.

Considering that this is a file coded in Python, please use the appropriate platform.

In this file, you will find a machine learning pipeline for making predictions based on the dataset provided. Data was pre-processed (cleaning, standardization, etc.) and then trained with three different machine learning models (Random Forest classification, SVM, Logistic Regression). 

To evaluate the performance of the models and their predictions, all three models were evaluated using F1 with macroaverging.

How to run this file?

This is .ipynb file that can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. 
Since the dataset is uploaded from local system, you will have to ensure that the dataset is already existing/downloaded in your system.
